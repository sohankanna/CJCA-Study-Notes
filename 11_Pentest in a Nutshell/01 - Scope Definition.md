# Scope Definition 



## 1. The Foundation of Trust: The NDA

Before any sensitive information is exchanged, both parties must sign a **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**.

*   **What it is:** A legal contract that legally binds the penetration tester (and their company) to maintain the confidentiality of all sensitive information they are exposed to during the engagement.
*   **Why it's crucial:** It creates a safe, legal environment for the client to share the details necessary to plan the test, such as network diagrams, credentials, or past security issues. It protects the client from data leaks and protects the tester by defining the rules for handling that data.
*   **What it covers:**
    *   System details and security weaknesses.
    *   Private company information and trade secrets.
    *   Employee and customer data.

## 2. The Scoping Process

With the NDA in place, the process of defining the actual scope of the test begins. This is a collaborative effort to determine what will be tested.

### a) The Scoping Questionnaire
*   **What it is:** A checklist or series of questions sent to the client to gather the necessary information to plan the test.
*   **Purpose:** To understand the client's technology, security needs, and the specific goals for the penetration test.

### b) The Scoping Document / Statement of Work (SOW)
*   **What it is:** The formal document, created from the information in the questionnaire, that details the final, agreed-upon plan for the test.
*   **Purpose:** To eliminate any ambiguity and ensure that both the testers and the client have the exact same understanding of the engagement's boundaries and objectives.

## 3. Defining the Scope of Work

The final scoping document (or SOW) is the most important contract of the engagement. It must clearly define the following elements:

| Element | Description | Example for this Module |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goals** | What is the business objective of the test? What does the client want to achieve? | To assess and confirm the security of a new, small environment. |
| **Scope / Limits**| What specific systems, IP addresses, and applications are **in-scope** for testing? What is explicitly **out-of-scope**? | **In-Scope:** One Linux web server and one Windows server. <br> **Out-of-Scope:** Everything else. |
| **Methodology** | What type of test will be conducted (Black Box, White Box, Gray Box)? | **Black Box:** The tester has no prior knowledge of the target systems. |
| **Schedule**| When is the testing permitted to occur? What are the start and end dates? | For this module, there are no time constraints. In a real engagement, this would be a specific timeframe (e.g., "testing is only allowed between 10 PM and 6 AM"). |
| **Roles** | Who is responsible for what? | Our role is to assist the main penetration testing team. |
| **Deliverables**| What will be provided at the end of the engagement? | We will provide our findings to the team lead. (In a real engagement, this would be a formal report). |

**Key Takeaway:** A well-defined scope is the most critical element of a successful and professional penetration test. It ensures the test is valuable to the client, legally sound, and safe to execute.
