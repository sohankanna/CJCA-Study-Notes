# 02 - Rules of Engagement


## 1. What are the Rules of Engagement?

The **RoE** is the detailed "contract" for the hands-on portion of a penetration test. While the Statement of Work (SOW) covers the high-level business and legal aspects, the RoE provides the granular, technical ground rules that the testing team must follow.

**Core Idea:** The RoE sets clear expectations and boundaries to ensure the test is conducted effectively, safely, and legally, preventing misunderstandings and minimizing risk to the client's operations.

## 2. Key Components of an RoE Document

### a) Defining the Boundaries (Scope)
This is the most critical section. It explicitly defines what is to be tested and how.
*   **In-Scope Systems:** A precise list of IP addresses, network ranges, domain names, and applications that are authorized for testing.
*   **Out-of-Scope Systems:** An equally important list of systems that **must not be touched**.
*   **Testing Windows:** The specific dates and times when testing is permitted (e.g., "only between 10 PM and 6 AM on weekends").
*   **Forbidden Techniques:** Any specific attack methods that are not allowed (e.g., "no Denial of Service (DoS) attacks," "no social engineering").

### b) Contact Information and Communication
Clear and reliable communication is essential for a successful engagement.
*   **Key Contacts:** A list of names, roles, and 24/7 contact information (phone, email) for both the client and the testing team.
*   **Communication Channels:** The agreed-upon methods for communication (e.g., secure messaging app, encrypted email, ticketing system).
*   **Escalation Procedures:** A clear plan for how to **immediately** report critical vulnerabilities or any accidental system impacts.

### c) Objectives
This section clarifies the specific goals of the penetration test.
*   **Purpose:** Defines what the client wants to achieve (e.g., "test the security of the external web application," "simulate a malicious insider," "achieve PCI DSS compliance").
*   **Success Criteria:** Helps define what a "successful" test looks like by comparing the final results against the initial objectives.

### d) Evidence and Information Handling
This section outlines the procedures for managing the sensitive data collected during the test.
*   **Evidence Collection:** How testers will document their findings (e.g., screenshots, logs).
*   **Data Security:** How the collected sensitive data will be stored securely (e.g., on encrypted drives).
*   **Data Disposal:** The agreed-upon process for securely destroying all client data after the engagement is complete.

## 3. Legal and Authorization Components

### a) Disclaimers and Liability
This section protects both parties by setting realistic expectations.
*   **Limited Liability:** A clause stating that the testers are not liable for issues arising from the exploitation of previously unknown ("zero-day") vulnerabilities.
*   **Point-in-Time Assessment:** A disclaimer clarifying that the test results represent a snapshot of the system's security *at that specific moment* and do not guarantee future security.

### b) Explicit Permission
*   **The "Get Out of Jail Free" Letter:** The RoE itself, or a separate authorization letter, serves as formal, written proof that the testing activities are authorized. Testers should have this document readily available, especially during physical or on-site assessments.
*   **Third-Party Authorization:** If any in-scope assets are hosted by a third party (e.g., a cloud provider like AWS or Azure), the RoE must specify that the client has obtained the necessary permission from that provider for the test to be conducted. Testing cloud infrastructure without the provider's approval can violate their terms of service.
