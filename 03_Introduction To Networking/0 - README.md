# Module: Introduction to Networking

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles, protocols, and technologies that underpin all modern computer networks. It moves beyond the high-level concepts of the first module into the practical details of how networks are structured, how devices communicate, and how data is securely transmitted.

The primary goal of this section is to build a solid technical foundation in networking, which is an absolutely essential skill set for any cybersecurity professional.

## Module Sections (Notes)

Below is a list of the topics covered in this module. Each note builds upon the last, starting with broad concepts and moving to specific protocols and technologies.

1.  **Networking Overview:** Contrasts "flat" vs. "segmented" network designs and introduces core security principles like the DMZ and the importance of proper subnetting.

2.  **Network Types:** Categorizes networks by their geographical scope, covering common terminology (LAN, WAN, VPN) and academic terms (MAN, PAN). It also details the different types of VPNs (Site-to-Site, Remote Access, SSL).

3.  **Networking Topologies:** Describes the physical and logical layouts of networks, including Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, and Hybrid topologies.

4.  **Proxies:** Explains the role of proxies as intermediaries, detailing the differences between Forward, Reverse, and Transparent proxies and their use cases in security.

5.  **Networking Models:** A focused review of the theoretical 7-layer OSI model and the practical 4-layer TCP/IP model, with an emphasis on the process of data encapsulation.

6.  **The OSI Model:** A detailed, layer-by-layer breakdown of the 7-layer reference model, explaining the function of each layer from the Physical to the Application layer.

7.  **The TCP/IP Model:** A breakdown of the 4-layer practical model of the internet, focusing on its core tasks and protocols like TCP, IP, and DNS.

8.  **The Network Layer:** A deep dive into OSI Layer 3, covering its core functions of Logical Addressing (IP) and Routing.

9.  **IP Addresses:** Details the structure of an IPv4 address, the concepts of Network/Host parts, Subnet Masks, and CIDR notation.

10. **Subnetting:** Explains the process of dividing a large IP address range into smaller, manageable, and secure subnets, including how to calculate network and broadcast addresses.

11. **MAC Addresses:** Covers the Layer 2 physical address, its structure (OUI), and the critical role of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in local network communication.

12. **IPv6 Addresses:** Introduces the next-generation 128-bit IP address, its structure, shortening rules, and key advantages over IPv4.

13. **Networking Key Terminology:** A comprehensive glossary of essential networking acronyms and protocols, grouped by function (e.g., routing, security, web).

14. **Common Protocols:** A practical list of the most common TCP and UDP protocols and their standard port numbers.

15. **Wireless Networks:** Covers the fundamentals of Wi-Fi, including security protocols (WEP, WPA2/3), common attacks, and network hardening best practices.

16. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):** Explains how VPNs create secure tunnels over public networks, with a focus on the core technologies like IPsec.

17. **Vendor Specific Information:** A look at technologies heavily associated with specific vendors, focusing on Cisco IOS and the implementation of VLANs for network segmentation.

18. **Key Exchange Mechanisms:** Discusses the cryptographic methods (like Diffie-Hellman and RSA) used to securely establish shared secret keys over an insecure channel.

19. **Authentication Protocols:** A glossary of protocols and frameworks (like Kerberos, SAML, and OAuth) used to verify the identity of users and devices.

20. **TCP/UDP Connections:** A detailed comparison of the two main transport layer protocols and an exploration of the IP Packet structure that carries them.

21. **Cryptography:** An overview of the foundational concepts of encryption, including Symmetric vs. Asymmetric algorithms (AES, RSA) and common cipher modes of operation.
