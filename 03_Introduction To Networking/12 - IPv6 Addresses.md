# IPv6 Addresses
**IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)** is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. It is a 128-bit address, designed to eventually replace the 32-bit IPv4.

**Core Idea:** IPv6 provides a virtually inexhaustible number of IP addresses, eliminating the need for complex workarounds like NAT and enabling true end-to-end connectivity for every device.

### IPv4 vs. IPv6: Key Differences

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bit Length** | 32-bit | **128-bit** |
| **Address Space**| ~4.3 billion addresses | ~340 undecillion (3.4 x 10³⁸) addresses |
| **Representation**| Dotted-Decimal (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) | **Hexadecimal** (e.g., `fe80::dd80:b1a9:6687:2d3b`)|
| **CIDR Notation**| e.g., `/24` | e.g., `/64` |
| **Dynamic Addressing**| DHCP | **SLAAC** (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) / DHCPv6 |
| **IPsec Support**| Optional | **Mandatory** (built-in) |
| **Broadcasts** | Uses broadcast addresses | **No broadcasts**; uses multicast instead. |

## IPv6 Address Structure and Notation

An IPv6 address is a 128-bit number, represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.

*   **Full Address Example:** `fe80:0000:0000:0000:dd80:b1a9:6687:2d3b`

### Shortening Rules (RFC 5952)
To make these long addresses more manageable, several shortening rules apply:
1.  **Omit leading zeros:** Any leading zeros in a 16-bit block can be removed.
    *   `0db8` becomes `db8`
    *   `0000` becomes `0`
2.  **Collapse consecutive blocks of zeros:** One (and only one) sequence of consecutive zero-blocks can be replaced with a double colon `::`.
    *   `fe80:0000:0000:0000:dd80...` becomes `fe80::dd80...`

*   **Shortened Address Example:** `fe80::dd80:b1a9:6687:2d3b`

### Address Parts
A typical IPv6 unicast address is split into two 64-bit halves:
1.  **Network Prefix (first 64 bits):**
    *   Identifies the specific network and subnet. This part is assigned by the ISP and network administrators.
2.  **Interface Identifier (last 64 bits):**
    *   Uniquely identifies the specific device (network interface) on that subnet.
    *   This can be automatically generated by the device itself, often using its MAC address (**SLAAC**), or assigned by DHCPv6.

## IPv6 Address Types

IPv6 simplifies addressing by eliminating broadcast addresses and refining communication types.

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unicast** | An address that identifies a **single, unique interface**. A packet sent to a unicast address is delivered to that one specific interface. |
| **Anycast** | An address that identifies a **set of interfaces** (typically on different devices). A packet sent to an anycast address is delivered to the **closest** or "best" interface in that set, as determined by the routers. Often used for services like DNS to direct users to the nearest server. |
| **Multicast** | An address that identifies a **group of interfaces**. A packet sent to a multicast address is delivered to **all** interfaces that have joined that multicast group. This is used for one-to-many communication, replacing the function of broadcast in IPv4. |

## The Hexadecimal System
IPv6 uses hexadecimal because it is a much more compact way to represent binary data.
*   **Base:** Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system.
*   **Characters:** It uses the numbers `0-9` and the letters `A-F` to represent values from 0 to 15.
*   **Efficiency:** A single hexadecimal digit can represent a 4-bit binary number (a "nibble"). This makes converting between binary and hex straightforward and the resulting addresses much shorter to write.
