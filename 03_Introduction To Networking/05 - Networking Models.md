# Networking Models 

## The Two Core Models: A Quick Review

Both the OSI and TCP/IP models are layered frameworks that describe how data communication occurs between systems. They break down a complex process into smaller, manageable parts.

### 1. The OSI Model
*   **Full Name:** Open Systems Interconnection Model.
*   **Layers:** 7 layers.
*   **Role:** Primarily a **theoretical reference model**. It is incredibly detailed and is used as a standard for teaching, designing networks, and troubleshooting. It provides a comprehensive vocabulary for describing network functions.

### 2. The TCP/IP Model
*   **Full Name:** Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol Model.
*   **Layers:** 4 layers.
*   **Role:** The **practical implementation model** that the modern internet is built upon. It's a more condensed version of the OSI model, designed around the core protocols of the internet.

| OSI Model (7 Layers) | TCP/IP Model (4 Layers) | Key Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Application (7) | | |
| Presentation (6)| **Application** | User-facing data and services (e.g., HTTP, DNS). |
| Session (5) | | |
| Transport (4) | **Transport** | End-to-end communication and data delivery (TCP/UDP). |
| Network (3) | **Internet** | Routing packets across networks using logical addresses (IP). |
| Data Link (2) | **Link / Network Access**| Physical addressing (MAC) and transmission over a local medium. |
| Physical (1) | | |

## Data Encapsulation and PDUs

**Encapsulation** is the process of wrapping data with the necessary protocol information as it passes *down* the layers of the network model on the sending device. The reverse process on the receiving device is called **decapsulation**.

Each "chunk" of data at a specific layer is called a **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)**.

### The Encapsulation Process (Sending Data)
Imagine you are sending an email.

1.  **Application Layer:** Your email text is the initial **Data**.
2.  **Transport Layer:** The data is broken into chunks, and a TCP header is added (with source/destination ports). This new PDU is now a **Segment**.
3.  **Internet Layer:** An IP header is added to the segment (with source/destination IP addresses). This PDU is now a **Packet**.
4.  **Link Layer:** A frame header and trailer are added to the packet (with source/destination MAC addresses). This PDU is now a **Frame**.
5.  **Physical Layer:** The frame is converted into a stream of **Bits** (1s and 0s) and sent over the physical medium (e.g., Ethernet cable).

Each layer adds its own "envelope" (header) to the data, which is then opened by the corresponding layer on the receiving end.

## Relevance for a Penetration Tester

Understanding both models is crucial for a penetration tester's work.

*   **The TCP/IP Model (The "What"):**
    *   This is the model you interact with daily. You exploit vulnerabilities in Application layer protocols (like HTTP), manipulate Transport layer protocols (like in a TCP SYN scan), and work with IP addresses at the Internet layer. It's the practical map of the internet.

*   **The OSI Model (The "How" and "Why"):**
    *   This model is your troubleshooting and analysis framework. When you capture network traffic with a tool like **Wireshark**, you are looking at the different layers of the OSI model.
    *   It helps you understand *why* an attack is working (or not working). For example, if your web exploit isn't working, you can use the OSI model to diagnose the problem layer by layer:
        *   *Layer 1 (Physical):* Do I even have a network connection?
        *   *Layer 3 (Network):* Can I `ping` the target? Is there a router or firewall blocking my packets?
        *   *Layer 4 (Transport):* Is the target port (e.g., 443) open?
        *   *Layer 7 (Application):* Is there a WAF or proxy interfering with my HTTP request?

**Key Takeaway:** A penetration tester uses their knowledge of the TCP/IP model to formulate attacks and their knowledge of the OSI model to analyze traffic and troubleshoot why those attacks succeed or fail.
