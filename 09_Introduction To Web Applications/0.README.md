# Module: Introduction to Web Applications

This module provides a foundational overview of the architecture, components, and security principles of modern web applications. The notes cover everything from the basic front-end technologies that render a webpage to the complex back-end infrastructure that powers it.

Understanding how web applications are built is the first and most critical step toward learning how to secure them. This module lays the essential groundwork for web application penetration testing, covering the core concepts that underpin the most common and critical vulnerabilities.

## Module Sections (Notes)

Below is a list of the topics covered in this module, organized to build a comprehensive understanding of web application structure and security.

### 1. Core Concepts & Architecture
*   **Introduction:** Defines what a web application is, contrasting it with static websites and native OS applications, and introduces the significant security risks they face.
*   **Web Application Layout:** Explores the different infrastructure models (One Server, Many Servers) and the logical three-tier architecture (Presentation, Application, Data) of web applications.
*   **Front End vs. Back End:** Details the crucial separation between client-side (Front End) and server-side (Back End) development, outlining the key components and responsibilities of each.

### 2. Front-End Technologies & Vulnerabilities
*   **HTML:** Covers the basics of HyperText Markup Language, the structural foundation of all web pages, including the Document Object Model (DOM) and URL encoding.
*   **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):** Explains the role of CSS in styling and presenting web content.
*   **JavaScript:** Introduces the programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic functionality to the front end.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Discusses the vulnerability of leaving sensitive information (like credentials or hidden paths) in the client-side source code.
*   **HTML Injection:** Covers the vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into a webpage, leading to defacement or phishing.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Explains the critical vulnerability of injecting malicious JavaScript into a webpage, covering the three main types: Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Details the attack that tricks an authenticated user's browser into making an unintended, malicious request to a web application.

### 3. Back-End Technologies & Vulnerabilities
*   **Back End Servers:** Discusses the role of the underlying hardware and operating system that hosts the web application and common software "stacks" like LAMP.
*   **Web Servers:** An overview of the most common web server software (Apache, Nginx, IIS) and their role in handling HTTP traffic.
*   **Databases:** Covers the difference between Relational (SQL) and Non-Relational (NoSQL) databases and how they are used to store application data.
*   **Development Frameworks & APIs:** Introduces the concept of back-end frameworks (Laravel, Django, etc.) and the APIs (REST, SOAP) that connect the front end to the back end.
*   **Common Web Vulnerabilities:** A high-level look at critical back-end flaws like Broken Authentication/Access Control, Malicious File Upload, Command Injection, and SQL Injection.
*   **Public Vulnerabilities:** Explains how to find and assess publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in web applications and their components using resources like Exploit-DB and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
