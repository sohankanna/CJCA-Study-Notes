# Hack The Box - Certified Junior Cybersecurity Analyst (CJCA) Study Notes

Welcome to my personal study repository for the Hack The Box Certified Junior Cybersecurity Analyst (CJCA) certification path. This repository serves as a living document of my learning journey, containing my notes, summaries, and custom diagrams on the various modules covered in the course.

The purpose of this project is to solidify my own understanding of the concepts through active learning and to create a public portfolio that demonstrates my dedication and knowledge in the field of cybersecurity.
