# Introduction 

The Windows operating system includes two primary built-in command-line interfaces (CLIs): the **Command Prompt (CMD.exe)** and **PowerShell**. These powerful tools provide direct access to the operating system, enabling users to:

- Automate routine tasks.
    
- Gain granular control over the computer and its applications.
    
- Effectively administer Windows hosts.
    

From a penetration testing perspective, mastering these CLIs is essential for reconnaissance, exploitation, and exfiltrating data from a Windows environment.

#### 2. Command Prompt vs. PowerShell

While both are command-line tools, PowerShell is a significant evolution from the traditional Command Prompt. A key functional difference is that you can run standard CMD commands from within a PowerShell console, but to run a PowerShell command from CMD, you must first launch the PowerShell engine (e.g., powershell Get-Process).

Here are the other key differences:

| Feature             | PowerShell                                                                    | Command Prompt                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Release Year**    | Introduced in 2006.                                                           | Introduced in 1981 (as part of MS-DOS).                       |
| **Command Types**   | Can run both batch commands and PowerShell cmdlets.                           | Can only run batch commands.                                  |
| **Aliases**         | Supports the use of command aliases for brevity.                              | Does not support command aliases.                             |
| **Output Handling** | Output is treated as an object, which can be passed to other cmdlets.         | Output is simple text; it cannot be passed to other commands. |
| **Scripting**       | A powerful scripting language with an Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE). | A command must finish before the next one can run.            |
| **Framework**       | Built on the .NET framework, allowing access to programming libraries.        | Cannot access these libraries.                                |
| **Compatibility**   | Can be run on Linux and macOS systems.                                        | Can only be run on Windows systems.                           |
As highlighted, PowerShell is a more dynamic and powerful scripting language designed for complex tasks and automation, whereas the Command Prompt is a more static, legacy tool.
