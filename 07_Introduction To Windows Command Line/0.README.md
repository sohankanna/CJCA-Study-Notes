# Module: Introduction to Windows Command Line

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to the Windows command-line environment, covering both the legacy **Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`)** and the modern, powerful **PowerShell**. The notes progress from basic navigation and file management to advanced concepts like service control, registry manipulation, and scripting.

Mastering these shells is an essential skill for any administrator or penetration tester. It enables efficient system management, deep reconnaissance, and the automation of complex tasks, providing a level of control that the graphical user interface cannot match.

## Module Sections (Notes)

The notes are organized into two main parts, reflecting the two primary shells of the Windows operating system.

### Part 1: The Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`)
This section covers the foundational knowledge of the traditional Windows command-line interpreter.

1.  **Introduction:** A high-level overview of the module and the importance of the command line.
2.  **Command Prompt Basics:** Defines what `cmd.exe` is, how to access it, and its basic usage, including the "Sticky Keys" bypass case study.
3.  **Getting Help:** Covers the essential built-in help features like the `help` command, the `/?` switch, and `doskey` for command history.
4.  **System Navigation:** Details the use of `dir`, `cd`, and `tree` for moving around the filesystem and understanding its structure.
5.  **Working with Directories and Files - CMD:** Covers the core commands for managing the filesystem: `mkdir`, `rd`, `copy`, `move`, `del`, and the powerful `robocopy`, along with I/O redirection (`>`, `>>`, `|`).
6.  **Gathering System Information:** A deep dive into host enumeration using commands like `systeminfo`, `ipconfig`, `arp`, and `whoami` to gain situational awareness.
7.  **Finding Files and Directories:** Explores the tools for searching the filesystem, including `where` for finding executables and `find`/`findstr` for searching text within files.
8.  **Environment Variables:** Explains the concept of environment variables, their scope (System, User, Process), and how to manage them with `set` and `setx`.
9.  **Managing Services:** Covers the management of Windows services from the command line using the `sc.exe` utility to query, start, stop, and modify them.
10. **Working with Scheduled Tasks:** Details the use of the `schtasks` command to create, query, and delete scheduled tasks, a critical skill for understanding persistence mechanisms.

### Part 2: PowerShell
This section transitions to the modern, object-oriented shell, building upon the concepts from Part 1.

11. **CMD vs. PowerShell:** A comparison of the two shells, highlighting PowerShell's object-based pipeline and extensibility.
12. **All About Cmdlets and Modules:** Explains the `Verb-Noun` structure of cmdlets, the object-oriented output, and how modules are used to extend PowerShell's functionality.
13. **User and Group Management:** Covers the PowerShell cmdlets for managing both local and Active Directory users and groups (`Get-LocalUser`, `Get-ADUser`, etc.).
14. **Working with Files and Directories - PowerShell:** Details the modern, consistent cmdlets for filesystem management (`Get-ChildItem`, `New-Item`, `Remove-Item`, etc.).
15. **Finding & Filtering Content:** A deep dive into the PowerShell pipeline and object manipulation using `Select-Object`, `Where-Object`, and the `grep`-like `Select-String`.
16. **Working with Services:** Covers the `*-Service` family of cmdlets for powerful, scriptable management of local and remote Windows services.
17. **Working with the Registry:** Explains how to navigate and manage the Windows Registry as if it were a filesystem, using cmdlets like `Get-ItemProperty` and `New-Item`.
18. **Working with the Windows Event Log:** Details how to query and filter the Windows Event Logs using the `wevtutil.exe` command and the powerful `Get-WinEvent` PowerShell cmdlet.
19. **Networking Management from The CLI:** Covers the modern `Net` cmdlets for managing network adapters and settings, and the setup of remote management protocols like SSH and WinRM.
20. **Interacting With The Web:** Explores the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` and the `.Net.WebClient` class to download files and interact with web services from the command line.
21. **PowerShell Scripting and Automation:** A summary of how to create a basic PowerShell module, including functions, comment-based help, and exporting members to build reusable tools.
