# Module: Web Requests

This module provides a deep dive into the foundational protocol of the internet: the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**. The notes cover the anatomy of web requests and responses, the various methods and status codes that govern communication, and the critical role of headers in managing state and security.

A thorough understanding of how web requests work is an absolute prerequisite for anyone in the field of cybersecurity, especially those focused on web application penetration testing or bug bounty hunting. This module provides the essential knowledge needed to analyze, manipulate, and craft web requests using tools like `cURL` and browser developer tools.

## Module Sections (Notes)

Below is a list of the topics covered in this module, organized to build a comprehensive understanding of web requests from the ground up.

1.  **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP):** An introduction to the core client-server protocol of the web, the anatomy of a URL, and the basic HTTP flow including DNS resolution.

2.  **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS):** Explains the importance of encryption, how HTTPS uses TLS to secure communication, and the process of the TLS handshake.

3.  **HTTP Requests and Responses:** A detailed breakdown of the structure of both HTTP requests and responses, including the request/status line, headers, and body.

4.  **HTTP Headers:** A comprehensive look at the different categories of headers (General, Entity, Request, Response, and Security) and their specific purposes.

5.  **HTTP Methods and Status Codes:** Covers the common HTTP request "verbs" (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.) and the five classes of HTTP status codes that servers use to respond.

6.  **The `GET` Method:** A practical focus on the most common HTTP method, including how to handle HTTP Basic Authentication and analyze `GET` requests with `cURL` and browser developer tools.

7.  **The `POST` Method:** A detailed look at the `POST` method, covering its use in login forms, state management with cookies, and how to send different data formats like JSON.

8.  **CRUD APIs:** An introduction to interacting with a common type of API that maps the four fundamental data operations (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) to the standard HTTP methods (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
