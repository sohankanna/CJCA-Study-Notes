# 08 - Internet Architecture 

## 1. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

In a **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)** network, every device (or "peer") acts as both a **client and a server**. Peers communicate directly with each other to share resources without the need for a central, controlling server.

*   **Core Idea:** Decentralization. The workload and resources are distributed among all participants.
*   **Analogy:** A group of friends sharing photos directly from each other's computers instead of uploading them all to a central website.
*   **Example:** **BitTorrent** for file sharing, blockchain/cryptocurrency networks.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Scalability:** The network becomes more powerful as more peers join.
    *   **Resilience:** No single point of failure. If one peer goes offline, the network continues to function.
    *   **Cost-Efficient:** The burden of storage and bandwidth is shared among all peers.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Complex Management:** Difficult to enforce security policies or updates across all peers.
    *   **Security Challenges:** Each peer is a potential entry point for malware.
    *   **Unreliable Availability:** Resources can disappear if the peers hosting them go offline.

## 2. Client-Server Architecture

The **Client-Server** model is the most common architecture on the internet. It involves **clients** (user devices) that request services from **servers** (powerful, centralized computers) that provide those services.

*   **Core Idea:** Centralization. A central server holds the data and logic, and clients connect to it.
*   **Analogy:** A customer (client) ordering from a restaurant (server). The restaurant has all the ingredients and staff to fulfill the order.
*   **Example:** Accessing a website, sending an email, using a database.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Centralized Control:** Easy to manage, secure, and update the central server.
    *   **Reliability & Performance:** Servers can be optimized and maintained for high performance.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Single Point of Failure:** If the central server fails, the entire service becomes unavailable.
    *   **High Cost:** Requires powerful server hardware and constant maintenance.
    *   **Potential for Congestion:** The server can be overwhelmed if too many clients make requests simultaneously.

### The Tiered Model
The client-server architecture is often broken into "tiers" to improve scalability and organization.
*   **Two-Tier:** **Client <--> Database Server.** (e.g., a simple desktop application).
*   **Three-Tier:** **Client <--> Application Server (Business Logic) <--> Database Server.** This is the standard for most modern web applications. The client (browser) talks to a web/application server, which then talks to the database.
*   **N-Tier:** Any architecture with more than three tiers, used for highly complex, distributed systems.

## 3. Hybrid Architecture

A **Hybrid** model combines elements of both P2P and Client-Server architectures to get the best of both worlds.

*   **Core Idea:** Use a central server for coordination, but transfer the bulk of the data directly between peers.
*   **Analogy:** A ride-sharing app. A central server (Client-Server) connects you with a driver, but the actual ride (the main "service") is a direct, P2P interaction between you and the driver.
*   **Example:** Video conferencing apps (like Zoom or Discord). A central server manages the login, user lists, and call setup, but the video and audio streams are often sent directly between participants (P2P) to reduce lag.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Efficiency:** Reduces the load on the central server.
    *   **Control:** Retains centralized control for important tasks like authentication and user management.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Complexity:** More difficult to design and implement.
    *   **Partial Single Point of Failure:** If the central coordinating server fails, peers may not be able to find each other.

## 4. Cloud Architecture

**Cloud Architecture** refers to applications and services that are hosted on infrastructure managed by a third-party provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). It is fundamentally a large-scale, virtualized client-server model.

*   **Core Idea:** Outsource the management of physical hardware to a cloud provider and access computing resources on-demand over the internet.
*   **Example:** Google Drive, Dropbox, Netflix.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    1.  **On-demand self-service:** Users can provision resources automatically.
    2.  **Broad network access:** Services are available from any internet-connected device.
    3.  **Resource pooling:** The provider's resources are shared among multiple customers.
    4.  **Rapid elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down instantly based on demand.
    5.  **Measured service:** Users pay only for the resources they consume.
*   **Advantages:** High scalability, reduced cost and maintenance, flexibility.
*   **Disadvantages:** Vendor lock-in, potential security/compliance concerns, reliance on internet connectivity.

## 5. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Architecture

**SDN** is a modern network architecture that separates the network's **control plane** (the "brain" that decides where traffic goes) from the **data plane** (the "muscle" that actually forwards the traffic).

*   **Core Idea:** Centralize network intelligence in a software-based **SDN controller**. The physical network devices (switches, routers) become simple forwarding devices that just obey the controller's instructions.
*   **Analogy:** A city's traffic system. In a traditional network, each traffic light at each intersection makes its own decisions. In an SDN, a central traffic control center (the controller) has a view of the entire city and tells every single traffic light when to turn green or red to optimize traffic flow for the whole city.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Centralized Control:** Simplifies network management.
    *   **Programmability & Automation:** Network policies can be changed and deployed instantly via software.
    *   **Efficiency:** Can dynamically optimize traffic paths in real-time.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Controller Vulnerability:** The central controller is a critical single point of failure.
    *   **Complexity:** Requires new skills and specialized tools to manage.
