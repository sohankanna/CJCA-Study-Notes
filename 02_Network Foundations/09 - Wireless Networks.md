# 09 - Wireless Networks

A **wireless network** uses radio waves to connect devices like computers, smartphones, and IoT gadgets to a network, including the internet.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mobility** | Users can move freely within the network's coverage area. |
| **Ease of Installation** | No need for physical cables, making setup simpler and cleaner. |
| **Scalability** | Adding new devices to the network is easy. |

| Disadvantages | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Interference** | Signals can be weakened or disrupted by physical obstacles (walls) or other electronic devices (microwaves, Bluetooth). |
| **Security Risks** | Wireless signals are broadcast through the air, making them easier to intercept than wired traffic if not properly secured (e.g., with strong encryption). |
| **Speed Limitations** | Generally slower and less stable than a comparable wired (Ethernet) connection. |

## Key Wireless Technologies

### 1. Wireless Router / Access Point (for Wi-Fi)
A **wireless router** is the central hub of a typical home or small office wireless network (Wi-Fi). It combines several functions:
*   **Routing:** Directs traffic between your local network and the internet.
*   **Wireless Access Point (AP):** Broadcasts the Wi-Fi signal that your devices connect to.
*   **Switch:** Most routers include LAN ports for connecting wired devices.

The router connects to a **modem**, which is the device that provides the internet connection from your ISP.

### 2. Mobile Hotspot
A **mobile hotspot** is a feature on a smartphone (or a dedicated device) that shares its **cellular data connection** (4G/5G) with other devices via Wi-Fi.
*   **Use Case:** Provides internet access on the go when a regular Wi-Fi network is not available.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Uses your cellular data plan.
    *   Has a shorter range than a dedicated router.
    *   Can significantly drain the device's battery.

### 3. Cell Tower (for Cellular Networks)
A **cell tower** is the backbone of a **cellular network** (e.g., 4G LTE, 5G). It's a structure with antennas and electronic equipment that provides wireless coverage to a specific geographic area, known as a "cell."
*   **How it Works:** As you move with your mobile phone, your connection is seamlessly "handed off" from one cell tower to the next to maintain a continuous connection.
*   **Cell Types:**
    *   **Macro Cells:** Large towers that provide wide coverage over several kilometers, common in rural areas.
    *   **Micro/Small Cells:** Smaller, lower-power installations used in dense urban areas to increase capacity and fill coverage gaps.

## Frequencies in Wireless Communications

Wireless signals are radio waves transmitted at specific **frequencies**, measured in Hertz (Hz). The frequency band determines the characteristics of the signal, such as its range and speed.

### Common Frequency Bands

| Band | Used By | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.4 GHz** | Older Wi-Fi standards (802.11b/g/n), Bluetooth, microwaves. | **Longer range**, better at penetrating walls. **More prone to interference** due to being very crowded. |
| **5 GHz** | Newer Wi-Fi standards (802.11n/ac/ax). | **Faster speeds**, less interference. **Shorter range** and less effective at penetrating solid objects. |
| **Cellular Bands** | 4G (LTE) and 5G networks. | A wide range of licensed frequencies. Lower frequencies (e.g., 700 MHz) provide wide coverage, while higher frequencies (e.g., 28 GHz "millimeter wave" for 5G) provide extremely high speeds over a very short distance. |

**Key Trade-off:** There is always a trade-off between **range** and **speed/bandwidth**.
*   **Lower Frequencies:** Travel farther but carry less data.
*   **Higher Frequencies:** Carry much more data but have a shorter range.
