# Module 02: Network Foundations

This module dives into the essential concepts that form the backbone of all computer networking. Moving beyond a high-level overview, these notes cover the theoretical models, core protocols, physical components, and critical services that allow devices to communicate, both on a local network and across the global internet.

The primary goal of this section is to build a practical understanding of how data actually moves from a source to a destination, providing the foundational knowledge required for network traffic analysis and security.

## Module Sections (Notes)

Below is a list of the topics covered in this module, detailing the key components and processes of network communication.

1.  **Introduction to Networks:** Defines what a network is and introduces the two primary types: Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).

2.  **Network Concepts:** Explores the fundamental theoretical frameworks (OSI and TCP/IP models), common network protocols (TCP, UDP, IP), and various data transmission methods.

3.  **Components of a Network:** Breaks down the essential hardware and software that make up a functional network, including end devices, intermediary devices (routers, switches), network media, and servers.

4.  **Network Communication:** Explains the three crucial addressing schemes—MAC addresses (Physical), IP addresses (Logical), and Ports (Application)—that work together to direct data to the right place.

5.  **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):** Covers the automated process (DORA) that assigns IP addresses and network configurations to devices as they join a network.

6.  **Network Address Translation (NAT):** Details the process that allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address, explaining the difference between public and private IPs.

7.  **Domain Name System (DNS):** Describes the "phonebook of the internet," which translates human-readable domain names into the numerical IP addresses computers use.

8.  **Internet Architecture:** Compares and contrasts the different network models, such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P), Client-Server, Hybrid, Cloud, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

9.  **Wireless Networks:** Covers the fundamentals of wireless communication, including Wi-Fi, mobile hotspots, cell towers, and the different frequency bands (2.4 GHz vs. 5 GHz).

10. **Network Security:** Introduces the core defensive technologies used to protect a network, focusing on Firewalls and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).

11. **Data Flow Example:** A comprehensive, step-by-step summary that ties all the previous concepts together by tracing a single web request from a user's laptop to a web server and back.

12. **Skills Assessment:** A practical summary of applying these networking concepts within the Hack The Box lab environment, including analyzing network interfaces and enumerating a target with tools like `ping` and `nmap`.
