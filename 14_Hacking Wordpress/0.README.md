# Module: Hacking WordPress

This module provides a focused, hands-on guide to the security assessment of **WordPress**, the world's most popular Content Management System (CMS). Given that WordPress powers a vast portion of the internet, understanding its structure, common vulnerabilities, and attack vectors is an essential skill for any penetration tester.

The notes in this module cover the entire lifecycle of a WordPress assessment, from initial reconnaissance and automated scanning to manual exploitation and post-exploitation, culminating in gaining full control of the underlying server.

## Module Sections (Notes)

Below is a list of the topics covered in this module, organized to follow the logical flow of a professional WordPress penetration test.

### 1. Foundations
*   **Introduction:** A high-level overview of what WordPress and a Content Management System (CMS) are, and why their popularity and extensibility make them a prime target for attackers.
*   **WordPress Structure:** A breakdown of the default file and directory structure of a WordPress installation, highlighting the purpose of critical files like `wp-config.php` and key directories like `wp-content` and `wp-admin`.
*   **WordPress User Roles:** An explanation of the five default user roles (Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, Subscriber) and their corresponding privilege levels.

### 2. Enumeration
*   **WordPress Core Version Enumeration:** Details the manual techniques for discovering the exact version of the core WordPress software by inspecting the page source for `generator` tags and version strings in asset links.
*   **Plugins and Themes Enumeration:** Covers both passive (source code analysis) and active (brute-forcing) methods for identifying all installed plugins and themes, which are the primary source of vulnerabilities.
*   **Directory Indexing:** Explains the web server misconfiguration of directory indexing and how it can be used to discover files, including those from deactivated but still-vulnerable plugins.
*   **User Enumeration:** Details the manual techniques for discovering valid usernames, such as author ID iteration and exploiting the legacy REST API endpoint.

### 3. Exploitation & Post-Exploitation
*   **WPScan Overview:** An introduction to **WPScan**, the essential automated scanner for WordPress, covering its key features and command-line options.
*   **WPScan Enumeration:** A practical walkthrough of using WPScan to perform a comprehensive enumeration of a target, identifying versions, themes, plugins, and users.
*   **Exploiting a Vulnerable Plugin:** Demonstrates how to take a vulnerability identified by WPScan (in this case, a Local File Inclusion - LFI) and manually exploit it to read sensitive files from the server.
*   **Attacking WordPress Users:** Covers the process of performing a password brute-force attack against the enumerated users, focusing on the more effective `xmlrpc.php` vector.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the Theme Editor:** The critical post-exploitation step of leveraging a compromised Administrator account to edit a theme's PHP file and insert a web shell, gaining full control over the web server.
*   **Attacking WordPress with Metasploit:** Demonstrates how to automate the administrator-to-RCE attack path using a dedicated Metasploit module (`wp_admin_shell_upload`).

### 4. Defense
*   **WordPress Hardening:** A comprehensive guide to the essential best practices for securing a WordPress installation. This includes performing regular updates, managing plugins securely, using security plugins, hardening user management, and applying secure configuration changes.
