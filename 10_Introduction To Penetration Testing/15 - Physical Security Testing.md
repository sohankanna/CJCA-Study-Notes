# 15 - Physical Security Testing

## 1. The Goal of a Physical Pentest

The primary objective is to identify and exploit weaknesses in the physical security layers that protect an organization's most critical assetsâ€”its people, data, and infrastructure. It answers the question: "Can an unauthorized person get into our building and access sensitive areas?"

## 2. Key Components of a Physical Security Assessment

A physical pentest evaluates multiple layers of defense.

### a) Perimeter Security
*   **What it is:** The outermost layer of defense.
*   **Targets:** Fences, gates, walls, lighting, and landscaping.
*   **Assessment:** Looking for weaknesses like gaps in fences, poorly lit areas that provide cover, or climbable structures.

### b) Access Control Systems
*   **What it is:** The mechanisms that control entry into the building and restricted areas.
*   **Targets:** Key card systems, biometric readers, PIN pads, and traditional locks.
*   **Assessment:** Attempting to bypass these controls through techniques like **badge cloning** (copying an RFID card), lock picking, or simply checking for propped-open or unsecured doors.

### c) Surveillance and Monitoring
*   **What it is:** The systems used to detect and observe activity.
*   **Targets:** Security cameras, motion sensors, and intrusion detection alarms.
*   **Assessment:** Identifying camera blind spots, testing the response to triggered alarms, and determining if surveillance is actively monitored.

### d) Human Element
*   **What it is:** The people responsible for enforcing security policies. This is often the weakest link.
*   **Targets:** Security guards, receptionists, and general employees.
*   **Assessment:** Using **social engineering** to test security awareness and adherence to procedures.

## 3. The Physical Pentest Methodology

### 1. Information Gathering (OSINT)
The test begins with **passive reconnaissance**.
*   **Activities:** Studying satellite imagery (Google Maps) to map the facility layout, reviewing social media for employee information and photos of badges, and analyzing public documents to understand the organization's structure.

### 2. On-Site Observation
Testers conduct surveillance of the target facility.
*   **Activities:** Observing employee entry/exit patterns, identifying main entrances and less-trafficked side doors, noting security guard patrol routes and shift changes, and looking for common "smoker's doors" that are often left unsecured.

### 3. Exploitation (The Breach Attempt)
With proper authorization, testers attempt to bypass security controls.
*   **Common Techniques:**
    *   **Tailgating / Piggybacking:** The most common and effective technique. The tester, often carrying boxes or looking busy, simply follows an authorized employee through a secure door before it closes.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Posing as a delivery driver, IT support, or a new employee to trick staff into granting access.
    *   **Technical Bypasses:** Using specialized tools to pick locks or clone RFID access cards.

## 4. Legal and Ethical Considerations

Physical penetration testing carries significant legal and personal risk. **It is illegal and dangerous without explicit, written authorization.**

*   **The "Get Out of Jail Free" Letter:** This is a **mandatory** document that every tester must carry on their person during a physical engagement. It is a formal letter from the client organization that:
    *   Explicitly authorizes the testing activities.
    *   Defines the scope and approved timeframes.
    *   Provides emergency contact information for both the client and the testing firm.
*   **Do No Harm:** The primary principle. The tester's actions must not cause any real damage to property or pose a risk to people.
*   **Privacy:** The tester must respect the privacy of individuals and handle any sensitive information discovered with the utmost confidentiality.
