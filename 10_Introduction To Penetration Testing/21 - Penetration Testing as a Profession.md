# 21 - Penetration Testing as a Profession

## 1. The Career Path

Penetration testing has evolved from a niche role into a crucial and in-demand profession within cybersecurity.

*   **Job Market:** High demand for skilled testers exists across all sectors, including corporations, government agencies, and consulting firms, leading to competitive salaries and strong growth potential.
*   **Career Progression:** Testers often start in general IT or entry-level security roles. With experience, they can advance to senior tester positions, lead teams, or become independent consultants. The skills are also highly transferable to other senior roles like Security Architect or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
*   **Navigating Entry-Level Roles:** Be wary of "entry-level" job postings that demand many years of experience. A good employer will value potential, a passion for learning, and hands-on experience (from labs, CTFs, etc.) over impossible prerequisites.
