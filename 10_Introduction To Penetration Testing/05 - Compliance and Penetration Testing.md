# 05 - Compliance and Penetration Testing
	
## 1. What is Compliance-Focused Penetration Testing?

A **compliance-focused penetration test** is a security assessment designed specifically to meet the requirements of a particular law, regulation, or industry standard.

*   **Core Idea:** The goal is not only to find vulnerabilities but also to provide documented evidence that the organization is performing due diligence to protect sensitive data as required by law.
*   **Impact:** Failing to comply can result in severe consequences, including massive financial penalties, legal action, loss of certifications, and significant reputational damage.

## 2. Major Regulatory Frameworks Requiring Pentesting

While many regulations exist globally, several key frameworks explicitly or implicitly mandate regular penetration testing.

| Framework | Acronym | Industry / Region | Requirement for Pentesting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard**| PCI DSS | Global (Card Payments) | **Explicitly mandatory.** Requires annual penetration testing and after any significant changes. |
| **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act**| HIPAA | US (Healthcare) | **Implicitly required.** Mandates regular risk assessments, for which penetration testing is a standard and expected component to protect patient data (ePHI). |
| **General Data Protection Regulation**| GDPR | European Union (Personal Data)| **Implicitly required.** Requires "regular testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures" to protect the personal data of EU citizens. |
| **System and Organization Controls 2**| SOC 2 | Global (Service Orgs) | **Implicitly required.** Encourages penetration testing as a key method to validate the effectiveness of the security controls being audited. |

## 3. The Methodology of a Compliance-Focused Test

A compliance test follows a structured methodology to ensure its results are valid for audit purposes.

### a) Scoping
*   The scope of the test is carefully defined based on the specific systems and data that fall under the regulation (e.g., for PCI DSS, this is the "Cardholder Data Environment"). This is often more rigid than a standard pentest.

### b) Documentation
*   Meticulous and detailed documentation is crucial. Every step, tool, and finding must be recorded to serve as evidence for auditors.

### c) Risk Assessment
*   Vulnerabilities are evaluated not just on their technical severity but also on their specific **regulatory impact**. A medium-technical risk might be a high-compliance risk if it directly violates a specific rule.

## 4. Reporting for Compliance

A compliance report has specific requirements beyond a standard technical report.

*   **Executive Summary:** Must clearly address how the findings relate to specific compliance requirements.
*   **Detailed Findings:** Each vulnerability must be mapped back to the specific control or regulation it violates.
*   **Remediation Guidance:** Recommendations must be actionable and help the organization achieve compliance.
*   **Attestation:** The report often includes a formal statement from the testing firm, attesting that the test was performed according to the required standards.

## 5. Challenges and Best Practices

### Common Challenges
*   **Scope Management:** Balancing comprehensive testing against the strict and sometimes limiting boundaries defined by the compliance standard.
*   **Testing Limitations:** Regulations may restrict certain aggressive testing techniques to avoid disrupting critical production systems.
*   **Continuous Compliance:** Many regulations require ongoing testing, which necessitates a sustainable, repeatable testing program.

### Best Practices
*   **Engage Qualified Testers:** Use testers who are experts not only in hacking techniques but also in the specific compliance framework.
*   **Maintain a Testing Calendar:** Schedule regular tests to meet annual requirements and to test after any major system changes.
*   **Integrate with Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC):** Penetration testing should be a key input into the organization's overall GRC program, not a standalone activity.
