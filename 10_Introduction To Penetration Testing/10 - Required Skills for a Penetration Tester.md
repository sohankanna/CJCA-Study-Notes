# 10 - Required Skills for a Penetration Tester

## 1. Technical Hard Skills

These are the foundational, non-negotiable technical competencies.

### a) Networking Fundamentals
A deep understanding of networking is essential, as nearly all attacks traverse a network.
*   **Protocols:** In-depth knowledge of the TCP/IP suite (TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP) and common application layer protocols (HTTP/S, DNS, SMB, FTP).
*   **Architecture:** Understanding of concepts like LANs/WANs, subnetting, routing, and network segmentation.
*   **Analysis:** Ability to use tools like **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network traffic to understand communications and find weaknesses.

### b) Operating Systems Knowledge
Proficiency in both major operating systems is critical.
*   **Linux:** This is the primary platform for most security tools. Strong command-line skills (`bash`), knowledge of the filesystem hierarchy, permission models, and service management are required.
*   **Windows:** Deep familiarity with the Windows OS, including the command line (CMD and PowerShell), file system (NTFS), the Registry, services, and the fundamentals of Active Directory.

### c) Programming and Scripting
While not a full-time developer role, the ability to read and write code is crucial for automation and tool customization.
*   **Scripting (Essential):** Proficiency in at least one scripting language. **Python** is the de facto standard in the security community. **Bash** scripting is also essential for working in Linux environments.
*   **Programming (Beneficial):** Understanding of languages like C/C++, Java, or C# helps in analyzing compiled applications and understanding vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.

### d) Web Technologies
Web applications are a massive attack surface, making this a critical area of expertise.
*   **Front End:** Understanding of HTML, CSS, and especially **JavaScript** to identify client-side vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Back End:** Familiarity with server-side languages (PHP, Python, Node.js) and how web applications interact with databases.
*   **Concepts:** Knowledge of sessions, cookies, APIs (REST), and web servers (Apache, Nginx).

### e) Security Concepts and Tools
*   **Vulnerability Knowledge:** A strong understanding of common vulnerability classes (OWASP Top 10, etc.), such as SQL Injection, buffer overflows, misconfigurations, and privilege escalation techniques.
*   **Tool Proficiency:** The ability to effectively use a standard pentesting toolkit, including:
    *   **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS
    *   **Exploitation Frameworks:** Metasploit
    *   **Web Proxies:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
    *   **Network Scanners:** Nmap

## 2. Analytical and Soft Skills

Technical knowledge alone is not enough. These skills are what separate a good tester from a great one.

### a) Problem-Solving and Analytical Thinking
*   **Attacker Mindset:** The ability to think creatively and "outside the box" to find novel ways to bypass security controls.
*   **Analytical Skills:** The capacity to piece together disparate bits of information from various sources to form a complete attack chain.

### b) Communication and Reporting
*   **Written Communication:** The ability to write clear, concise, and professional reports that explain complex technical vulnerabilities to both technical (IT staff) and non-technical (management) audiences.
*   **Verbal Communication:** The ability to clearly articulate findings, risks, and recommendations to clients.

### c) Legal and Ethical Considerations
*   **Ethics:** An unwavering commitment to a strict ethical code. The ability to handle sensitive information with complete confidentiality and integrity is paramount.
*   **Legal Knowledge:** Understanding the legal boundaries of a test, the importance of a signed contract and scope, and awareness of relevant compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).

### d) Continuous Learning
*   The cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing. A successful penetration tester must be a **lifelong learner**, actively staying up-to-date with new technologies, vulnerabilities, and attack techniques.

### e) Professionalism and Project Management
*   **Time Management:** The ability to manage complex projects and meet deadlines.
*   **Emotional Intelligence:** The capacity to handle sensitive situations, manage client expectations, and maintain professional conduct at all times.
