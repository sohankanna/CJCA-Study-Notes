# Module: Footprinting

This module provides a comprehensive, in-depth exploration of the **Information Gathering** and **Enumeration** phase of a penetration test. Footprinting is the systematic process of discovering, collecting, and correlating information about a target system or network to build a detailed map of its attack surface.

The quality of the information gathered during this phase directly dictates the success of all subsequent stages of an engagement. This module covers the enumeration of a wide variety of common network services, providing the foundational knowledge needed to effectively analyze and understand a target environment.

## Module Sections (Notes)

Below is a list of the services and concepts covered in this module, organized to provide a systematic approach to target enumeration.

### 1. Foundational Concepts
*   **Enumeration Principles:** Establishes the core mindset for information gathering, emphasizing a methodical, knowledge-driven approach over blindly running tools.
*   **Enumeration Methodology:** Outlines a structured, 6-layered model for enumeration, providing a logical framework for moving from external reconnaissance to deep internal system analysis.

### 2. External Reconnaissance (OSINT)
*   **Domain Information:** Covers passive, OSINT techniques for discovering a target's internet presence, including finding subdomains and related hosts through DNS records and Certificate Transparency logs.
*   **Cloud Resources:** Details methods for discovering an organization's cloud assets (S3 buckets, Azure blobs) using Google dorking, source code analysis, and specialized third-party tools.
*   **Staff:** Explores the process of gathering intelligence on a company's employees through public sources like job postings and LinkedIn to identify the technologies in use and craft targeted attacks.

### 3. Service-Specific Enumeration
This section deep-dives into the practical enumeration of common network services.

*   **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Covers the enumeration of the classic file transfer service, focusing on identifying anonymous access, information leaks, and insecure configurations.
*   **SMB (Server Message Block):** Details the enumeration of the primary Windows file sharing protocol, including discovering shares, testing for null/guest access, and identifying dangerous settings like SMBv1 enablement.
*   **NFS (Network File System):** Explores the enumeration of the traditional Unix/Linux file sharing service, focusing on discovering exported shares and exploiting common misconfigurations like `no_root_squash`.
*   **DNS (Domain Name System):** Covers querying DNS servers for various record types and highlights the critical impact of a successful DNS Zone Transfer (`AXFR`).
*   **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Details the enumeration of the email relay protocol, focusing on identifying user accounts with `VRFY`/`EXPN` and testing for dangerous open relays.
*   **IMAP / POP3:** Explores the enumeration of email retrieval protocols, including how to identify server capabilities and check for cleartext authentication.
*   **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** Covers the enumeration of the network management protocol, focusing on brute-forcing community strings and "walking" the MIB tree to extract a wealth of system information.
*   **MySQL:** Details the enumeration of the popular open-source database, including version detection, testing for weak credentials, and basic post-authentication queries.
*   **MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server):** Covers the enumeration of Microsoft's enterprise database, focusing on version detection, authentication modes, and identifying dangerous settings like `xp_cmdshell`.
*   **Oracle TNS:** Explores the enumeration of the Oracle database listener, including SID brute-forcing and using specialized tools like `odat` to find credentials.
*   **IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface):** Details the enumeration of out-of-band server management controllers, focusing on default credentials and the critical IPMI v2.0 password hash leak vulnerability.

### 4. Remote Management Protocols
*   **Linux Remote Management Protocols:** Covers the enumeration of the two main remote access protocols for Linux: the secure **SSH** and the legacy, insecure **R-Services**.
*   **Windows Remote Management Protocols:** Details the enumeration of the three primary Windows remote access methods: **RDP** (graphical), **WinRM** (command-line/PowerShell), and **WMI** (scripting/API).
