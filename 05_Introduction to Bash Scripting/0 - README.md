# Module: Introduction to Bash Scripting

This module provides a foundational introduction to Bash scripting, the art of automating tasks on Unix-like operating systems. While previous modules focused on using the shell interactively, this section explores how to write scripts to execute a series of commands, control their flow with logic, and handle data efficiently.

Mastering Bash scripting is a critical skill that elevates a user from simply running commands to building powerful, custom tools. For a cybersecurity professional, this means the ability to automate reconnaissance, parse large volumes of data, and streamline repetitive tasks during an engagement.

## Module Sections (Notes)

Below is a list of the topics covered in this module, organized to build a solid, practical foundation in Bash scripting.

1.  **Bourne Again Shell (Bash):** Introduces Bash as a scripting language, explains how to execute scripts, and provides a high-level breakdown of a sample script's anatomy.

2.  **Conditional Execution:** Covers the fundamental `if-elif-else` control structure and the special variables (`$#`, `$0`, `$1`, etc.) used to make logical decisions within a script.

3.  **Arguments, Variables, and Arrays:** Details the core components for storing and manipulating data: arguments (how scripts receive input), variables (how data is stored), and arrays (how lists of data are stored).

4.  **Comparison Operators:** A comprehensive guide to the operators used within conditional statements to compare strings, integers, and file attributes.

5.  **Arithmetic:** Explains how to perform mathematical operations in Bash using arithmetic expansion `$((...))` and the arithmetic context `((...))`.

6.  **Input and Output:** Covers how to make scripts interactive by accepting user input with the `read` command and how to manage output by displaying it on the screen while simultaneously saving it to a file with `tee`.

7.  **Flow Control - Loops:** Details the different types of loops (`for`, `while`, `until`) used to execute blocks of code repeatedly and how to control them with `break` and `continue`.

8.  **Flow Control - Branches:** Focuses on the `case` statement, a clean and readable alternative to `if-elif-else` for handling multiple, specific choices (like a menu).

9.  **Functions:** Explains how to group reusable blocks of code into functions to make scripts more organized, efficient, and easier to maintain. Covers passing parameters and returning values.

10. **Debugging:** Introduces the built-in debugging features of Bash, primarily the `-x` (xtrace) and `-v` (verbose) options, which are essential for finding and fixing errors in scripts.
