# Module 01: Introduction to Information Security

This module provides a high-level, foundational overview of the entire Information Security (InfoSec) landscape. It is the essential starting point for the CJCA path, establishing the core concepts, principles, threats, and professional roles that will be explored in greater detail in subsequent modules.

The primary goal of this section is to build a mental framework for understanding *why* cybersecurity is necessary and *how* it is broadly organized.
