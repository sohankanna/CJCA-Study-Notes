# 01-structure-of-infosec

InfoSec is the practice of protecting digital information and the systems that store and transmit it.

**Core Goals:**
*   **Prevent Unauthorized Viewing:** Keeping data confidential.
*   **Prevent Unauthorized Changing:** Maintaining data integrity.
*   **Prevent Unauthorized Destroying:** Ensuring data availability.

### The Castle Analogy
A simple way to understand InfoSec is to think of your data as treasure in a castle.

*   **The Treasure:** Your valuable data and information.
*   **The Castle Walls:** Defensive tools like **Firewalls** and **Encryption**.
*   **The Guards:** Security policies and **Access Controls** that monitor who comes and goes.
*   **The Thieves (Cyber Threats):** Malicious actors constantly looking for ways to breach the defenses.
*   **The Knights (Penetration Testers):** Ethical hackers who test the castle's defenses to find weaknesses before the thieves do.

## Core Components of the Digital World

The "digital world" is made up of several key interconnected parts.

*   **Client:** The user's device (PC, laptop, phone) used to access services.
*   **Network:** Two or more computers connected to communicate with each other.
*   **Internet:** A global network of interconnected computers and servers.
*   **Servers:** Powerful computers that provide services or applications (e.g., a web server hosting a website).
*   **Cloud:** A collection of remote servers (in a data center) that users can rent to store data or run applications.

## Key Security Concepts

Understanding the difference between these three terms is fundamental.

*   **Vulnerability:** A **weakness** or flaw in a system.
    *   *Example:* An unlocked door on a house.

*   **Threat:** A potential **danger** that could exploit a vulnerability.
    *   *Example:* A burglar in the neighborhood.

*   **Risk:** The **potential for loss or damage** when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
    *   *Example:* The chance that the burglar will enter through the unlocked door and steal things.

**The relationship is:** A **Threat** exploits a **Vulnerability**, which creates a **Risk**.

## Domains of Information Security

InfoSec is a broad field with many specializations. Key domains include:

*   **Network Security:** Protecting the network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls).
*   **Application Security:** Securing software and applications from vulnerabilities.
*   **Operational Security (OPSEC):** Protecting small pieces of information that could reveal a larger picture.
*   **Cloud Security:** Securing data and applications hosted in the cloud.
*   **Physical Security:** Protecting physical hardware like servers and laptops (locks, cameras).
*   **Mobile Security:** Securing smartphones and tablets.
*   **Internet of Things (IoT) Security:** Securing smart devices (cameras, thermostats).
*   **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity:** Planning for how to recover from major incidents.

## Key Roles in Information Security

Many different professionals work together to secure an organization.

*   **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):** The executive leader responsible for the entire security strategy.
*   **Security Architect:** Designs secure systems and networks from the ground up.
*   **Security Analyst:** The first line of defense; monitors systems for threats and analyzes security alerts.
*   **Incident Response Specialist:** Manages the response to active security breaches.
*   **Penetration Tester:** An "ethical hacker" who simulates attacks to find vulnerabilities.
*   **Compliance Specialist:** Ensures the company follows security laws and regulations.

### Security Teams

*   **Blue Team:** The **Defenders**. They manage security tools and respond to incidents.
*   **Red Team:** The **Attackers**. They simulate real-world adversaries to test the Blue Team's defenses.
*   **Purple Team:** The **Collaboration** between Red and Blue teams to share knowledge and improve overall security.
