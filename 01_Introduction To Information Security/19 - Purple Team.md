# 19 - Purple Team



A **Purple Team** is a cooperative model where the offensive (Red) and defensive (Blue) cybersecurity teams work together to maximize the effectiveness of an organization's security. It is a function of communication and feedback, not a separate group of people.

**Core Idea:** Instead of the Red Team operating in secret and then delivering a report weeks later, the Purple Team approach fosters a real-time, collaborative loop. Red Team attempts an attack, and the Blue Team tries to detect and block it. Immediately after, they discuss the results together.

### The Military Training Analogy
Imagine a kingdom's military preparing for an invasion.

*   **The Blue Team:** The knights who guard the castle walls.
*   **The Red Team:** A group of the kingdom's own elite soldiers who are trained to think like the enemy and launch simulated attacks on the castle to test the knights.
*   **The Purple Team Approach:** Instead of a surprise attack, the Red Team attackers and the Blue Team defenders are in direct communication. The Red Team says, "I'm going to try to scale the west wall now." The Blue Team tries to stop them. Afterwards, they huddle together: the Red Team explains *how* they found a weak spot, and the Blue Team explains *why* their lookout didn't see them. They improve defenses on the spot and repeat the exercise.

## Purpose of the Purple Team Approach

The primary goal of Purple Teaming is to create a continuous feedback loop that rapidly and efficiently improves an organization's security posture.

*   **Improve Security Defenses:** The Red Team's attack insights are immediately used to help the Blue Team strengthen defensive configurations and strategies.
*   **Enhance Detection and Response:** The Blue Team's feedback on what they can (and can't) see helps the Red Team create more realistic and valuable attack simulations.
*   **Encourage Continuous Improvement:** Fosters a culture of collaboration and constant learning, ensuring defenses evolve as quickly as threats do.
*   **Maximize Value of Security Testing:** Ensures that every simulated attack provides a direct and measurable improvement to the defensive capabilities.

## Key Activities in a Purple Team Exercise

| Activity | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Collaborative Security Testing** | Red and Blue Teams conduct joint, real-time exercises. The Red Team executes a specific attack technique, and the Blue Team immediately works to detect and respond to it, often with open communication. |
| **Knowledge Sharing & Skill Development** | This is the core of the approach. Red Teamers explain their offensive mindset and tools. Blue Teamers explain their detection logic and visibility gaps. Both teams gain a deeper understanding of the other's perspective. |
| **Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation** | The teams work together to stay current on the latest threats and vulnerabilities, jointly deciding which TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to test next. |
| **Enhanced Incident Response** | By practicing together constantly, the teams develop a more coordinated and effective response to real security incidents. |
| **Efficient Resource Allocation** | The immediate feedback loop helps prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities and threats, ensuring that time and money are spent on the most impactful security improvements. |

**Key Takeaway:** Purple Teaming transforms the relationship between offensive and defensive security from an adversarial test into a collaborative partnership focused on a single, shared objective: making the organization more secure.
