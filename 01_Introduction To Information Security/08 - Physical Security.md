08 - Physical Security

Physical security is the practice of protecting physical assets from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. In the context of InfoSec, this includes protecting computers, servers, networking equipment, and the buildings they are housed in.

**Core Idea:** The most advanced cybersecurity defenses are useless if an attacker can simply walk into your server room and steal a hard drive.

### The Candy Store Analogy
Think of physical security like protecting a candy store.

*   **The Assets:** The candy, the cash register, and the store itself.
*   **The Logical Security:** Locking the cash register (like encrypting data).
*   **The Physical Security:** Installing strong locks on the doors, setting up an alarm system, and having security cameras. If someone can't get into the store, they can't get to the cash register.

## The Goal of Physical Security: Defense in Depth

Physical security is built in layers to **Deter, Detect, Delay, and Respond** to threats.

1.  **Deter:** Make the target look difficult to attack.
    *   *Examples:* Fences, warning signs, visible security guards.
2.  **Detect:** Identify that an unauthorized entry is being attempted.
    *   *Examples:* Motion sensors, door alarms, security cameras.
3.  **Delay:** Slow down an attacker who has breached the first layers.
    *   *Examples:* Reinforced doors, man-traps, complex lock systems.
4.  **Respond:** Take action to neutralize the threat once it has been detected.
    *   *Examples:* On-site security personnel responding to an alarm, automatic notification to law enforcement.

## Common Physical Vulnerabilities

These are common weaknesses that physical penetration testers look for.

| Vulnerability                     | Description                                                                                    |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unsecured Access Points**       | Doors, windows, or loading docks that are left unlocked, propped open, or are easily bypassed. |
| **Weak Locks**                    | Using simple, low-quality locks that can be easily picked, bumped, or broken.                  |
| **Inadequate Perimeter Security** | Lack of fences, gates, or proper surveillance around the facility's perimeter.                 |
| **Poor Key/Badge Management**     | Failing to track keys or access cards, not revoking access for former employees.               |
| **Insufficient Lighting**         | Poorly lit areas around the building that can conceal intruders.                               |
| **Exposed IT Infrastructure**     | Servers, network jacks, or wiring closets that are in publicly accessible areas.               |
| **Lack of Visitor Management**    | Not having a formal process for signing in, badging, and escorting visitors.                   |
| **Unattended Workstations**       | Employees leaving their computers unlocked and accessible when they walk away.                 |

## Responsibility for Physical Security

Physical security is a shared responsibility across multiple departments and individuals.

*   **Strategy & Management:**
    *   A **Physical Security Team** or **Facilities Management**, often reporting to a **Chief Security Officer (CSO)** or **CISO**, is responsible for creating and maintaining the overall security plan.
*   **Implementation & Support:**
    *   The **IT Security Team** works with physical security to secure hardware and network equipment within the facility.
*   **Daily Practice:**
    *   **All Employees** have a responsibility to follow security protocols. This is often called maintaining a "security culture" (e.g., not tailgating through secure doors, locking their computers).
*   **Testing & Validation:**
    *   **Physical Penetration Testers** or **Red Teamers** are hired to simulate real-world physical attacks. They will attempt to bypass locks, tailgate employees, or use social engineering to gain unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas.
